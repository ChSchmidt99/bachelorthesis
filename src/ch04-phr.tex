\section{Progressive Hierarchical Refinement}
This section explains the bounding volume hierarchy construction algorithm at the core of this thesis, first introduced by Hendrich et al.~\cite{hendrich_parallel_2017}, as well as the contributions made by this work. These contributions include applying the approach to an interactive path tracer and introducing two approaches for optimizing the hyperparameters utilized by the algorithm.
