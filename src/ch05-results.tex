\section{Results}
This section further elaborates how benchmarking was conducted and presents the most important and noteworthy results.
\subsection{Benchmarking}
As mentioned before, one reason for using Go was the great built in benchmarking facility. All benchmarks at its core were conducted using said benchmarking facitily, executing each case ten times and averaging the result for more reliable results. Furthermore, the CPU, a AMD Ryzen 2600 eight core processor with 3.4 GHz, was locked to 90 percent capacity to prevent irregularities due to overheating or other high performance fluctuations.
